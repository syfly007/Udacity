    "In this lesson, we're going to go over a few really cool applications of Deep Learning using pre-trained models that others have generously provided on github. Don't worry if you don't understand what's going on! The goal is just for you to see the power of Deep Learning in a few different contexts and play around with these models. You'll get to dive deep into such models later on in the program. For now just have fun and plug in your own examples where possible!\n",

It automatically discovers the rules of the game by finding out how it did on each iteration.\n",
